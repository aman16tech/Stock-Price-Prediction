# Stock-Price-Prediction
Hi,
I have build a dashboard on the tableau platform which used to provide us the real-time movement which used to happen in the market mostly in indices such as Nifty &amp; Banknifty to avoid becoming part of a blood bath in the Indian Share Market.

So, Basically we have seen in new paper kind of financial bloodbath happens, whenever some unfortunate event is about to happen such as US market inflation or some kind of inside news or operated moment in 
indian stock market.
So to predict some momemt of it, for the first time this moment is detected in futures and then in options and then in stock prices.
I have written a code for fetching data from NSE websites and then getting it on google sheets and then with the help of visualisation tools i will be doing analysis for the same
in near real time and it shows me the price moment or volume moemt happening in market.

This is a very basic kind of project and can be upgraded to the next level using kibana or such kind of tools.
I have done this project on fun basis and it worked out.

if any updates or query
do post.

Thanks
Aman
